# Smart contract testing
This project use [harhat](https://hardhat.org/) tool-chain,
and [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) smart-contract framework.

## .env
You should touch a .env config file in the project root path,
the file looks like:
```angular2html
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=""
METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY=""
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=""
```
**!!And this file MUST NOT be committed to git-repo!!**

## deploy
hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>

## write a value into our new Contract

hardhat run scripts/store.js --network <network-name>

## then read the value out of our new Contract

hardhat run scripts/trace.js --network <network-name>

---

> '<network-name>' is in the ./hardhat.config.js 



> Where can I get my '<INFURA_PROJECT_ID>' ?
> Goto [infura](https://infura.io/) sign up an account,then Create a Project.
